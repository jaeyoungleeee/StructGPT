How many vocalists do we have?
### Here are the Sqlite SQL tables, with their properties:
#
# concert(*,concert_ID,concert_Name,Theme,Stadium_ID,Year);
# singer(*,Singer_ID,Name,Country,Song_Name,Song_release_year,Age,Is_male);
# singer_in_concert(*,concert_ID,Singer_ID);
# stadium(*,Stadium_ID,Location,Name,Capacity,Highest,Lowest,Average);
#
### How many vocalists do we have? Which tables do you need to complete the SQLite SQL query? Let's think step by step.
******
To determine the number of vocalists, we need to identify the table that contains information about vocalists. In this case, the "singer" table seems to be the relevant table as it contains information about singers.

To complete the SQLite SQL query, we would need the "singer" table. The query would look something like this:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM singer WHERE Is_male = 0;

This query selects the count of all records from the "singer" table where the "Is_male" column is equal to 0, indicating that the singer is a female vocalist.

Sure! Based on your response, provide only the required tables in the following format: 'Table_Name_1 | Table_Name_2' to simplify your response, which means using '|' to separate different tables. Don't use any other format or add any additional explanations.
