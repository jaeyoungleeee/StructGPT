How many vocalists do we have?
### Here are the Sqlite SQL tables, with their properties:
#
# concert(*,concert_ID,concert_Name,Theme,Stadium_ID,Year);
# singer(*,Singer_ID,Name,Country,Song_Name,Song_release_year,Age,Is_male);
# singer_in_concert(*,concert_ID,Singer_ID);
# stadium(*,Stadium_ID,Location,Name,Capacity,Highest,Lowest,Average);

### How many vocalists do we have? Which tables do you need to complete the SQLite SQL query? Let's think step by step.
******
To determine the number of vocalists, we need to identify the table that contains information about vocalists. In this case, the "singer" table seems to be the relevant table as it contains information about singers.

To complete the SQLite SQL query, we would need the "singer" table. The query would look something like this:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM singer WHERE Is_male = 0;

This query selects the count of all records from the "singer" table where the "Is_male" column is equal to 0, indicating that the singer is a female vocalist.

Sure! Based on your response, provide only the required tables in the following format: 'Table_Name_1 | Table_Name_2' to simplify your response, which means using '|' to separate different tables. Don't use any other format or add any additional explanations.

### How many departments offer any degree? Which tables do you need to complete the SQLite SQL query? Let's think step by step.
******
To determine how many departments offer any degree, we need to perform a query that involves the Departments and Degree_Programs tables.

Here are the steps to complete the SQLite SQL query:

1. Join the Departments and Degree_Programs tables using the department_id column as the common attribute.
2. Count the distinct department_id values from the Degree_Programs table.
3. Add a condition to the query to only include departments that have at least one degree program.

The SQL query to accomplish this would be:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dp.department_id) AS department_count
FROM Departments d
JOIN Degree_Programs dp ON d.department_id = dp.department_id
WHERE dp.degree_program_id IS NOT NULL;
```

This query will return the count of departments that offer any degree program.
