### Here are the Sqlite SQL tables, with their properties:
#
# concert(*,concert_ID,concert_Name,Theme,Stadium_ID,Year);
# singer(*,Singer_ID,Name,Country,Song_Name,Song_release_year,Age,Is_male);
# singer_in_concert(*,concert_ID,Singer_ID);
# stadium(*,Stadium_ID,Location,Name,Capacity,Highest,Lowest,Average);
#
### How many singers do we have? Which tables do you need to complete the SQLite SQL query? Let's think step by step.
******
To determine the number of singers, we need to query the "singer" table. 

The SQLite SQL query would be:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM singer;

This query will count the number of rows in the "singer" table, which represents the number of singers in the database.
******
Sure! Based on your response, provide only the required tables in the following format: 'Table_Name_1 | Table_Name_2' to simplify your response, which means using '|' to separate different tables. Don't use any other format or add any additional explanations.

### What is the total number of singers? Which tables do you need to complete the SQLite SQL query? Let's think step by step.
******
To find the total number of singers, we need to query the "singer" table. 

The SQLite SQL query would be:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM singer;

This query will count the number of rows in the "singer" table, which represents the total number of singers.

We only need the "singer" table to complete this query.

### Show name, country, age for all singers ordered by age from the oldest to the youngest. Which tables do you need to complete the SQLite SQL query? Let's think step by step.
******
To complete the SQLite SQL query to show the name, country, and age for all singers ordered by age from the oldest to the youngest, we will need the "singer" table.

The query can be written as follows:

SELECT Name, Country, Age
FROM singer
ORDER BY Age DESC;
