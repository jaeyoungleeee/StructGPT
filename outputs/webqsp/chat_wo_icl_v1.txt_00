The question is "what else did ben franklin invent?" and you'll start with "ben franklin". To answer this question, typically you would need to identify some relations that correspond to the meaning of the question. Therefore, select one relation from the candidate relations above that can be used to answer the question. Provide only one relevant relation that's present in the candidates, and begin your response with "The relevant relation: ".
******
The relevant relation: "law.inventor.inventions"
******
The triples are: (Benjamin Franklin, law.inventor.inventions, Lightning rod); (Benjamin Franklin, law.inventor.inventions, Glass harmonica); (Benjamin Franklin, law.inventor.inventions, Franklin stove); (Benjamin Franklin, law.inventor.inventions, Bifocals); (Benjamin Franklin, en, benjamin_franklin).
Based on these triples, if you believe you have gathered sufficient information to answer "what else did ben franklin invent?", give me the final answer entity and start your response with "The final answers:". You just need to provide only one answer entity. If you think you still do not have enough information to answer the question, respond "Need further information".
